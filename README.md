👋 &nbsp;Hi, I’m Ryan, I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with experience in C#, .Net, SQL Server, AngularJS, NodeJS, NoSQL DBs, and few other tools. <br />
<br />
👀 &nbsp;I’m interested in building useful tools with simple interfaces. I built the entire site at [lokii](https://lokii.com) using AngularJS, Firebase, and Node deployed on AWS. <br /> 
<br />
💞️ &nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! <br />
